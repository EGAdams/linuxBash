To make a GitHub submodule, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your Git repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Use the `git submodule add` command followed by the URL of the repository you want to add as a submodule. For example:
   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/smol-ai/developer.git
   ```
4. Git will clone the repository and add it as a submodule in your project.
5. Commit the changes to your repository using `git commit -m "Added submodule"`.
6. Push the changes to your remote repository using `git push`.

Now you have successfully added a GitHub submodule to your project.
