## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be an iOS application for iPad and iPhone that functions as an airplane speedometer gauge. It should provide real-time representation of speed, yaw, and other metrics. The application should incorporate customizable visual elements, such as the rim, face, and ticks, and leverage Core Animation for smooth visual transitions. It should also implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using Core Data. The application should prioritize compatibility across iOS devices and ensure an intuitive user experience. Additionally, it should provide synchronization capabilities with other aviation-related iOS applications.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Implement a real-time representation of yaw and other metrics", "P0"),
    ("Add customization options for visual elements (rim, face, ticks)", "P1"),
    ("Leverage Core Animation for smooth visual transitions", "P1"),
    ("Implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using Core Data", "P0"),
    ("Ensure compatibility across iOS devices (iPad and iPhone)", "P0")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The speedometer gauge application will have a clean and intuitive user interface. It will consist of a circular gauge with a customizable rim, face, and ticks. The gauge will display the current speed and other metrics in real-time. Users will be able to adjust the gauge metrics using intuitive controls. The application will also provide options to save and retrieve gauge metrics using Core Data. Smooth visual transitions and animations will be implemented using Core Animation. The design will prioritize compatibility across iOS devices, ensuring a consistent user experience on both iPad and iPhone.
