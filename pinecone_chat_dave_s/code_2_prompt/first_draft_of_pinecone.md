# Program Description

## Files

### main.py

This is the main file of the program. It serves as the entry point and orchestrates the execution of the program.

### utils.py

This file contains utility functions that are used throughout the program.

### data.py

This file defines the data structures used in the program.

## Functionality

The program is designed to perform a specific task, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided files. However, based on the contents of the files, we can infer the following functionality:

1. The program reads data from a file or an external source.
2. It processes the data using various functions defined in the program.
3. It stores the processed data in appropriate data structures.
4. It performs some calculations or transformations on the data.
5. It generates output based on the processed data.
6. It may write the output to a file or display it on the console.

## main.py

This file contains the main function that is responsible for executing the program. It performs the following tasks:

1. Imports necessary modules and functions from other files.
2. Defines the main function.
3. Calls functions from other files to perform the required tasks.
4. Handles any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the program.

## utils.py

This file contains utility functions that are used throughout the program. It includes the following functions:

1. `read_data(file_path)`: This function reads data from a file specified by the `file_path` parameter and returns it.
2. `write_data(file_path, data)`: This function writes the `data` to a file specified by the `file_path` parameter.
3. Other utility functions that are not explicitly mentioned in the provided files.

## data.py

This file defines the data structures used in the program. It includes the following data structures:

1. `DataStructure1`: This is a custom data structure that represents a specific type of data used in the program. It may have attributes and methods specific to its purpose.
2. `DataStructure2`: This is another custom data structure that represents a different type of data used in the program. It may also have attributes and methods specific to its purpose.

## Conclusion

Based on the provided files, the program appears to be a data processing application that reads data from a source, performs some calculations or transformations on the data, and generates output based on the processed data. The specific functionality and purpose of the program can only be determined by analyzing the implementation details of the functions and data structures defined in the files.
