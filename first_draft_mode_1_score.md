# Mode1Score::mode1P1Games() Method Description

This C++ method is part of a tennis scoring system and handles the scoring logic for Player 1 (P1) in Mode 1. Here's a breakdown of the method:

1. `_gameState->setServeSwitch( _gameState->getServeSwitch() + 1 );` - This line switches the serve between players. In tennis, players alternate serves throughout the match.

2. `if ( _player1->getGames() >= GAMES_TO_WIN_SET )` - This checks if Player 1 has won enough games to win a set. In tennis, a player must win a certain number of games to win a set.

3. `if ( _player1->getGames() == GAMES_TO_WIN_SET && _player2->getGames() == GAMES_TO_WIN_SET )` - This checks if both players have the same number of games won, which is equal to the number of games needed to win a set. This could indicate a tie situation.

4. `_gameState->setTieBreak( 1 );` and `_mode1TieBreaker.tieBreakEnable();` - These lines enable a tie-breaker. In tennis, if the game score reaches a certain level, a tie-breaker is used to determine the winner of the set.

5. `if (( _player1->getGames() - _player2->getGames()) > 1 )` - This checks if Player 1 has won more than one game than Player 2. In tennis, a player must win by at least two games to win a set.

6. `_player1->setSets( _gameState, _player1->getSets() + 1 );` - This increments the number of sets won by Player 1. In tennis, a match is won by the player who first wins a certain number of sets.

7. `_player1->getSets() == SETS_TO_WIN_MATCH` - This checks if Player 1 has won enough sets to win the match. In tennis, a match is won by the player who first wins a certain number of sets.
