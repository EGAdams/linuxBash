You are an expert in using debian linux.

The linux command below successfully uses the ftp command to "ftp"
in to an internet address and execute commands.

ftp -in << EOF
    open 192.168.1.110
    user dietpi@192.168.1.110 tinman88
    cd /rgb-rpi
EOF    

Please give me the similar command for ssh and not ftp.
