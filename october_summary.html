<h2>Summary of Conversation</h2>
<p>The conversation began with the user requesting a sequence diagram illustrating the actions during the test. The assistant provided a sequence diagram showing the flow of actions during the test, including the creation of test and run instances.</p>
<p>The user then asked for a description of the data saved into the database. The assistant provided an example of a Test object and explained how its attributes are stored in the database.</p>
<p>Next, the user asked for more meaningful variable names for certain methods. The assistant suggested alternative names that would improve code readability.</p>
<p>Finally, the user asked about the timing of data storage during the test. The assistant explained that the test data is written to the database once at the end of the test.</p>

<h2>Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Here are some relevant code snippets from the current codebase:</p>
