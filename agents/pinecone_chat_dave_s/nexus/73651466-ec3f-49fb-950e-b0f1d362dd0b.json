  "message": "The function `mode1ScoreTest` is likely a custom function that is specific to the code you are working with. Without seeing the code or any additional context, it is difficult to provide a specific answer. However, based on the name of the function, it is possible that `mode1ScoreTest` is used to calculate or evaluate a score in a particular mode or scenario.\n\nTo understand what `mode1ScoreTest` does, you can look for its definition in the codebase. It should be defined as a function with a specific set of parameters and a body that contains the logic for calculating the score. By examining the code within the function, you can determine what operations are being performed and how the score is being calculated.\n\nIf you are unable to find the definition of `mode1ScoreTest` in the codebase, it is possible that it is defined in an external library or module. In that case, you may need to consult the documentation or source code of that library to understand its functionality.\n\nIn summary, `mode1ScoreTest` is a custom function that likely calculates or evaluates a score in a specific mode or scenario. To understand its functionality, you will need to locate its definition in the codebase or consult the documentation of any relevant libraries or modules.",
