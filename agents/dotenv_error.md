```
The error message suggests that the 'load_dotenv' function cannot be imported from the 'dotenv' module. This could be due to a missing or incompatible version of the 'dotenv' package.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that the 'dotenv' package is installed by running the following command:
   ```
   pip3 install python-dotenv
   ```

2. If the package is already installed, try upgrading it to the latest version:
   ```
   pip3 install --upgrade python-dotenv
   ```

3. If the issue persists, it's possible that there is a conflict between different versions of the 'dotenv' package. In that case, you can try uninstalling the package and reinstalling it:
   ```
   pip3 uninstall python-dotenv
   pip3 install python-dotenv
   ```

After performing these steps, try running your Python script again using the command:
```
python3 PlanAndExecute.py
```

Hopefully, this will resolve the 'ImportError' and allow you to import the 'load_dotenv' function successfully.
