GitHub submodules are a feature in Git that allow you to include a Git repository as a subdirectory within another Git repository. This allows you to keep a separate repository as a subdirectory of your main repository, while still being able to track and manage changes to both repositories independently. Submodules are commonly used when you want to include external libraries or dependencies in your project.
