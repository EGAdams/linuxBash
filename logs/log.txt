2023-09-06 22:34:26.148 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:93 - ## Implementation approach
To design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following implementation approach:

1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data, an open-source framework provided by Apple, for managing the gauge metrics. Core Data provides a powerful and efficient way to handle data persistence, including CRUD operations, querying, and relationships between entities.

2. **User Interface**: We will use SwiftUI, an open-source framework introduced by Apple, for building the user interface. SwiftUI offers a declarative syntax, making it easier to create complex UI components and handle user interactions. It also provides built-in support for animations and transitions, which will help us achieve smooth visual transitions.

3. **Customization**: To allow customization of the gauge's appearance, we will utilize the open-source library called 'SwiftUIX'. SwiftUIX provides additional components and utilities that extend the functionality of SwiftUI, including customizable visual elements like colors, fonts, and shapes.

4. **Real-time Representation**: For real-time representation of aviation metrics, we will use Combine, an open-source framework introduced by Apple. Combine provides a declarative way to handle asynchronous events and data streams, allowing us to update the gauge's value in real-time.

5. **Compatibility**: To ensure compatibility across various iOS devices, we will use Auto Layout, an open-source framework provided by Apple. Auto Layout allows us to create adaptive and responsive layouts that can adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.

6. **Integration**: To enable easy integration of the gauge widget into larger applications, we will provide a Swift package. Swift packages are a lightweight and modular way to distribute and reuse code. By providing a Swift package, developers can easily add the gauge widget to their projects and customize it according to their needs.

The gauge widget will be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and will be designed modularly for easy integration into larger applications.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following implementation approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data, an open-source framework provided by Apple, for managing the gauge metrics. Core Data provides a powerful and efficient way to handle data persistence, including CRUD operations, querying, and relationships between entities.\n\n2. **User Interface**: We will use SwiftUI, an open-source framework introduced by Apple, for building the user interface. SwiftUI offers a declarative syntax, making it easier to create complex UI components and handle user interactions. It also provides built-in support for animations and transitions, which will help us achieve smooth visual transitions.\n\n3. **Customization**: To allow customization of the gauge\'s appearance, we will utilize the open-source library called \'SwiftUIX\'. SwiftUIX provides additional components and utilities that extend the functionality of SwiftUI, including customizable visual elements like colors, fonts, and shapes.\n\n4. **Real-time Representation**: For real-time representation of aviation metrics, we will use Combine, an open-source framework introduced by Apple. Combine provides a declarative way to handle asynchronous events and data streams, allowing us to update the gauge\'s value in real-time.\n\n5. **Compatibility**: To ensure compatibility across various iOS devices, we will use Auto Layout, an open-source framework provided by Apple. Auto Layout allows us to create adaptive and responsive layouts that can adjust to different screen sizes and orientations.\n\n6. **Integration**: To enable easy integration of the gauge widget into larger applications, we will provide a Swift package. Swift packages are a lightweight and modular way to distribute and reuse code. By providing a Swift package, developers can easily add the gauge widget to their projects and customize it according to their needs.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "GaugeViewModel.swift",\n    "GaugeMetricsManager.swift",\n    "GaugeDataModel.swift",\n    "GaugeCustomizationManager.swift",\n    "GaugeCustomizationModel.swift",\n    "GaugeDataPersistenceManager.swift",\n    "GaugeDataPersistenceModel.swift",\n    "GaugeMetricsAPI.swift",\n    "GaugeMetricsModel.swift",\n    "GaugeUIComponents.swift",\n    "GaugeUIStyles.swift",\n    "GaugeUIAnimations.swift",\n    "GaugeUIUtils.swift",\n    "GaugeUIExtensions.swift",\n    "GaugeUIResources.swift",\n    "GaugeUIConstants.swift",\n    "Main.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class GaugeView {\n        -

2023-09-06 22:43:03.885 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:93 - ## Implementation approach
To implement the gauge widget for iOS applications, we will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.

The challenges posed by the requirements are:
1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.
2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.
3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.
4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.
6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.

To address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:

1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget's user interface and handle user interactions.

2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.

3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations. We will use Core Animation to implement smooth visual transitions for the movement of the gauge hand, providing a realistic and engaging user experience.

4. **MySQL Connector**: MySQL Connector is an open-source library for Swift that provides a convenient API for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases. We will use MySQL Connector to implement the data management functionalities of the gauge widget, including adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics.

This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.\n\nThe challenges posed by the requirements are:\n1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.\n2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.\n3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales\' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.\n4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.\n6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget\'s user interface and handle user interactions.\n\n2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.\n\n3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations. We will use Core Animation to implement smooth visual transitions for the movement of the gauge hand, providing a realistic and engaging user experience.\n\n4. **MySQL Connector**: MySQL Connector is an open-source library for Swift that provides a convenient API for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases. We will use MySQL Connector to implement the data management functionalities of the gauge widget, including adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "DataModel.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "MySQLConnector.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        -GaugeView gaugeView\n        -DataModel dataModel\n        -DataManager dataManager\n        +init()\n        +start()\n        +end()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        -RimView rimView\n        -FaceView faceView\n        -ScaleMarksView scaleMarksView\n        -ScaleColorsView scaleColorsView\n        -HandView handView\n        -YawHandView yawHandView\n        +init()\n        +updateSpeed(speed: Double)\n        +updateYaw(yaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class RimView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(rimPaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class FaceView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(faceRect: Rect)\n    }\n\n    class ScaleMarksView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(scaleTickPaint: Paint, scaleTextPaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class ScaleColorsView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(yellowScalePaint: Paint, greenScalePaint: Paint, redScalePaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class HandView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(handPaint: Paint)\n        +moveToAngle(angle: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawHandView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(handPaint: Paint)\n        +moveToAngle(angle: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataModel{\n        -int speed\n        -int yaw\n        +init()\n        +getSpeed() -> int\n        +setSpeed(speed: int)\n        +getYaw() -> int\n        +setYaw(yaw: int)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        -MySQLConnector mySQLConnector\n        +init()\n        +adjustMetrics(speed: int, yaw: int)\n        +saveMetrics(speed: int, yaw: int)\n        +retrieveMetrics() -> (speed: int, yaw: int)\n    }\n\n    class MySQLConnector{\n        +init()\n        +connect(host: str, username: str, password: str, database: str)\n        +executeQuery(query: str) -> ResultSet\n    }\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataModel\n    participant DM as DataManager\n    participant MC as MySQLConnector\n\n    M->>G: init()\n    M->>D: init()\n    M->>DM: init()\n    M->>MC: init()\n    M->>G: updateSpeed(speed)\n    M->>G: updateYaw(yaw)\n    M->>DM: adjustMetrics(speed, yaw)\n    M->>DM: saveMetrics(speed, yaw)\n    M->>DM: retrieveMetrics()\n    M->>G: updateSpeed(speed)\n    M->>G: updateYaw(yaw)\n    M->>MC: connect(host, username, password, database)\n    M->>MC: executeQuery(query)\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points.]\n\n## Format example\n\n---\n## Required Swift third-party packages\n```swift\n"""\nflask==1.1.2\nbcrypt==3.2.0\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages\n```swift\n"""\nNo third-party ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec\n```swift\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\n...\ndescription: A JSON object ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis\n```swift\n[\n    ("game.swift", "Contains ..."),\n]\n```\n\n## Task list\n```swift\n[\n    "game.swift",\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n```swift\n"""\n\'game.swift\' contains ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nWe need ... how to start.\n---\n\n-----\nRole: You are a project manager; the goal is to break down tasks according to PRD/technical design, give a task list, and analyze task dependencies to start with the prerequisite modules\nRequirements: Based on the context, fill in the following missing information, note that all sections are returned in Swift code triple quote form seperatedly.

It should have smooth visual transitions and allow customization of visual elements. The widget should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within a larger application. It should also include data management functionalities for adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics, using MySQL for persistent storage. The user interface should be intuitive and visually clear, making it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance. The widget should be designed modularly to allow easy integration into larger applications and accommodate additional metrics.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n[\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the rim appearance.", "P0"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the face of the speedometer.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the scale marks.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the different scales\' color representation.", "P2"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the hand of the speedometer.", "P2")\n]\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget should have a circular shape with a customizable rim appearance. The face of the speedometer should be customizable as well. The scale marks should be displayed around the circumference of the gauge, with customizable colors and text. The hand of the speedometer should move smoothly in real-time to represent the current speed. The gauge widget should also have an inner circle with a hand representing the Yaw gauge, which should also move smoothly. The user interface should be designed to fit within the larger application and provide an intuitive and visually clear representation of speed measurements. The layout should be responsive and compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo implement the gauge widget for iOS applications, we will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.\n\nThe challenges posed by the requirements are:\n1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.\n2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.\n3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales\' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.\n4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.\n6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget\'s user interface and handle user interactions.\n\n2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.\n\n3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations. We will use Core Animation to implement smooth visual transitions for the movement of the gauge hand, providing a realistic and engaging user experience.\n\n4. **MySQL Connector**: MySQL Connector is an open-source library for Swift that provides a convenient API for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases. We will use MySQL Connector to implement the data management functionalities of the gauge widget, including adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "DataModel.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "MySQLConnector.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        -GaugeView gaugeView\n        -DataModel dataModel\n        -DataManager dataManager\n        +init()\n        +start()\n        +end()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        -RimView rimView\n        -FaceView faceView\n        -ScaleMarksView scaleMarksView\n        -ScaleColorsView scaleColorsView\n        -HandView handView\n        -YawHandView yawHandView\n        +init()\n        +updateSpeed(speed: Double)\n        +updateYaw(yaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class RimView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(rimPaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class FaceView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(faceRect: Rect)\n    }\n\n    class ScaleMarksView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(scaleTickPaint: Paint, scaleTextPaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class ScaleColorsView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(yellowScalePaint: Paint, greenScalePaint: Paint, redScalePaint: Paint)\n    }\n\n    class HandView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(handPaint: Paint)\n        +moveToAngle(angle: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawHandView{\n        +init()\n        +customizeAppearance(handPaint: Paint)\n        +moveToAngle(angle: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataModel{\n        -int speed\n        -int yaw\n        +init()\n        +getSpeed() -> int\n        +setSpeed(speed: int)\n        +getYaw() -> int\n        +setYaw(yaw: int)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        -MySQLConnector mySQLConnector\n        +init()\n        +adjustMetrics(speed: int, yaw: int)\n        +saveMetrics(speed: int, yaw: int)\n        +retrieveMetrics() -> (speed: int, yaw: int)\n    }\n\n    class MySQLConnector{\n        +init()\n        +connect(host: str, username: str, password: str, database: str)\n        +executeQuery(query: str) -> ResultSet\n    }\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataModel\n    participant DM as DataManager\n    participant MC as MySQLConnector\n\n    M->>G: init()\n    M->>D: init()\n    M->>DM: init()\n    M->>MC: init()\n    M->>G: updateSpeed(speed)\n    M->>G: updateYaw(yaw)\n    M->>DM: adjustMetrics(speed, yaw)\n    M->>DM: saveMetrics(speed, yaw)\n    M->>DM: retrieveMetrics()\n    M->>G: updateSpeed(speed)\n    M->>G: updateYaw(yaw)\n    M->>MC: connect(host, username, password, database)\n    M->>MC: executeQuery(query)\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##

The face of the speedometer should be customizable as well. The scale marks should be displayed around the circumference of the gauge, with customizable colors and text. The hand of the speedometer should move smoothly in real-time to represent the current speed. The gauge widget should also have an inner circle with a hand representing the Yaw gauge, which should also move smoothly. The user interface should be designed to fit within the larger application and provide an intuitive and visually clear representation of speed measurements. The layout should be responsive and compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo implement the gauge widget for iOS applications, we will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.\n\nThe challenges posed by the requirements are:\n1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.\n2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.\n3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales\' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.\n4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.\n6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget\'s user interface and handle user interactions.\n\n2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.\n\n3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations.

It should have smooth visual transitions and allow customization of visual elements. The widget should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within a larger application. It should also include data management functionalities for adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics, using MySQL for persistent storage. The user interface should be intuitive and visually clear, making it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance. The widget should be designed modularly to allow easy integration into larger applications and accommodate additional metrics.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n[\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the rim appearance.", "P0"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the face of the speedometer.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the scale marks.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the different scales\' color representation.", "P2"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the hand of the speedometer.", "P2")\n]\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget should have a circular shape with a customizable rim appearance. The face of the speedometer should be customizable as well. The scale marks should be displayed around the circumference of the gauge, with customizable colors and text. The hand of the speedometer should move smoothly in real-time to represent the current speed. The gauge widget should also have an inner circle with a hand representing the Yaw gauge, which should also move smoothly. The user interface should be designed to fit within the larger application and provide an intuitive and visually clear representation of speed measurements. The layout should be responsive and compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo implement the gauge widget for iOS applications, we will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.\n\nThe challenges posed by the requirements are:\n1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.\n2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.\n3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales\' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.\n4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.\n6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget\'s user interface and handle user interactions.\n\n2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.\n\n3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations. We will use Core Animation to implement smooth visual transitions for the movement of the gauge hand, providing a realistic and engaging user experience.\n\n4. **MySQL Connector**: MySQL Connector is an open-source library for Swift that provides a convenient API for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases. We will use MySQL Connector to implement the data management functionalities of the gauge widget, including adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics.\n\n## Swift Package

It should have smooth visual transitions and allow customization of visual elements. The widget should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within a larger application. It should also include data management functionalities for adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics, using MySQL for persistent storage. The user interface should be intuitive and visually clear, making it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance. The widget should be designed modularly to allow easy integration into larger applications and accommodate additional metrics.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n[\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the rim appearance.", "P0"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the face of the speedometer.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the scale marks.", "P1"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the different scales\' color representation.", "P2"),\n    ("The gauge widget should support customization of the hand of the speedometer.", "P2")\n]\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget should have a circular shape with a customizable rim appearance. The face of the speedometer should be customizable as well. The scale marks should be displayed around the circumference of the gauge, with customizable colors and text. The hand of the speedometer should move smoothly in real-time to represent the current speed. The gauge widget should also have an inner circle with a hand representing the Yaw gauge, which should also move smoothly. The user interface should be designed to fit within the larger application and provide an intuitive and visually clear representation of speed measurements. The layout should be responsive and compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo implement the gauge widget for iOS applications, we will follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. This will help us separate the concerns of data management, user interface, and business logic.\n\nThe challenges posed by the requirements are:\n1. Real-time representation of aviation metrics: We need to ensure that the gauge widget updates in real-time to reflect the current speed. This requires efficient data management and synchronization between the data source and the user interface.\n2. Smooth visual transitions: We need to implement smooth animations for the movement of the gauge hand. This can be achieved using Core Animation, which provides powerful animation capabilities.\n3. Customizable visual elements: We need to allow users to customize various visual elements of the gauge, such as the rim appearance, face of the speedometer, scale marks, different scales\' color representation, and the hand of the speedometer. We can achieve this by providing a flexible and customizable UI design.\n4. Data management: We need to implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics. We can use MySQL for persistent storage of these metrics, ensuring data integrity and reliability.\n5. Compatibility & User Experience: We need to ensure that the gauge widget is compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices. We also need to design an intuitive user interface with clear visuals to make it easy for users to understand speed measurements at a glance.\n6. Integration: We need to design the gauge widget in a modular way, allowing easy integration into larger applications. This will enable developers to use the widget without reinventing the wheel and accommodate additional metrics as needed.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will use the following open-source tools:\n\n1. **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI is a modern UI framework provided by Apple for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms. It offers a declarative syntax, making it easy to create interactive and visually appealing UI components. We will use SwiftUI to design the gauge widget\'s user interface and handle user interactions.\n\n2. **Combine**: Combine is a framework introduced by Apple for reactive programming in Swift. It provides a declarative API for handling asynchronous events and data streams. We will use Combine to manage data flow and synchronization between the data source and the user interface, ensuring real-time updates of the gauge widget.\n\n3. **Core Animation**: Core Animation is a powerful framework provided by Apple for creating smooth and visually appealing animations. We will use Core Animation to implement smooth visual transitions for the movement of the gauge hand, providing a realistic and engaging user experience.\n\n4. **MySQL Connector**: MySQL Connector is an open-source library for Swift that provides a convenient API for connecting to and interacting with MySQL databases. We will use MySQL Connector to implement the data management functionalities of the gauge widget, including adjusting, saving, and retrieving gauge metrics.\n\n## Swift Package

2023-09-06 23:27:38.485 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:93 - ## Implementation approach
To design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:

1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.

2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.

3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.

4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.

5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ## Required Swift third-party packages:\n```swift\n"""\nCoreData\nSwiftUI\nAlamofire\nSQLite.swift\nXCTest\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```swift\n"""\nNo third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```swift\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\n...\ndescription: A JSON object ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis:\n```swift\n[\n    ("MainView.swift", "MainView"),\n    ("GaugeView.swift", "GaugeView"),\n    ("Speedometer.swift", "Speedometer"),\n    ("YawGauge.swift", "YawGauge"),\n    ("DataManager.swift", "DataManager"),\n    ("NetworkManager.swift", "NetworkManager"),\n    ("DatabaseManager.swift", "DatabaseManager"),\n    ("TestManager.swift", "TestManager"),\n    ("TestReport.swift", "TestReport"),\n    ("Utils.swift", "Utils")\n]\n```\n\n## Task list:\n```swift\n[\n    "Utils.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "MainView.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge:\n```swift\n"""\nUtils.swift contains utility functions for formatting speed and yaw values.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points.]\n\n## Instructions:\n\n### Role:\n- Assume the role of a professional engineer.\n- Your primary objective is to write Swift code that adheres to PEP8 standards, ensuring the code is elegant, modular, easily readable, and maintainable.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n- Implement the code in just one file.

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ## Required Swift third-party packages:\n```swift\n"""\nCoreData\nSwiftUI\nAlamofire\nSQLite.swift\nXCTest\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages:\n```swift\n"""\nNo third-party packages required.\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec:\n```swift\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\n...\ndescription: A JSON object ...\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis:\n```swift\n[\n    ("MainView.swift", "MainView"),\n    ("GaugeView.swift", "GaugeView"),\n    ("Speedometer.swift", "Speedometer"),\n    ("YawGauge.swift", "YawGauge"),\n    ("DataManager.swift", "DataManager"),\n    ("NetworkManager.swift", "NetworkManager"),\n    ("DatabaseManager.swift", "DatabaseManager"),\n    ("TestManager.swift", "TestManager"),\n    ("TestReport.swift", "TestReport"),\n    ("Utils.swift", "Utils")\n]\n```\n\n## Task list:\n```swift\n[\n    "Utils.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "MainView.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge:\n```swift\n"""\nUtils.swift contains utility functions for formatting speed and yaw values.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Engineer: ## Utils.swift\n\nimport Foundation\n\nclass Utils {\n    static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String {\n        return String(format: "%.2f", speed)\n    }\n    \n    static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String {\n        return String(format: "%.2f", yaw)\n    }\n}\n]\n\n## Instructions:\n\n### Role:\n- Assume the role of a professional engineer.\n- Your primary objective is to write Swift code that adheres to PEP8 standards, ensuring the code is elegant, modular, easily readable, and maintainable.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n- Implement the code in just one file.

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##

It should be compatible with both iPad and iPhone devices and designed to fit within larger applications. The widget should also have smooth visual transitions and allow for easy integration and customization.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n- Implement a smooth hand movement using Core Animation for the gauge widget. (P0)\n- Allow users to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics using MySQL for persistent storage. (P1)\n- Ensure compatibility across various iOS devices. (P1)\n- Design clear visuals for easy understanding of speed measurements. (P2)\n- Provide customizable visual elements for the gauge widget. (P2)\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe gauge widget will have a circular shape with a rim appearance, a face for the speedometer, and scale marks for measurement. The gauge will have different color representations for different scales, such as yellow, green, and red. The hand of the speedometer will indicate the current speed, and there will be an additional hand for the Yaw gauge in the inner circle of the gauge. The user will be able to customize the appearance of the gauge, including the rim, face, scale marks, and hand. The gauge widget will be designed to fit within larger applications and will have smooth visual transitions for a better user experience.\n\n## Anything Unclear:\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nTo design a concise, usable, and complete iOS system for the gauge widget, we will follow the following approach:\n\n1. **Data Management**: We will use Core Data as the primary data management framework for the gauge widget. Core Data provides a high-level interface for managing the model layer objects in the application. It offers features like data persistence, data validation, and undo/redo support. Core Data is a powerful and widely used framework in iOS development.\n\n2. **User Interface**: For the user interface, we will use SwiftUI. SwiftUI is a modern UI framework introduced by Apple in iOS 13. It provides a declarative syntax for building user interfaces, making it easier to create complex layouts and animations. SwiftUI also offers built-in support for dynamic type, dark mode, and accessibility features.\n\n3. **Networking**: To handle network requests, we will use Alamofire. Alamofire is a widely used networking library in the iOS community. It provides a simple and elegant API for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and managing network tasks. Alamofire also supports features like authentication, background requests, and request chaining.\n\n4. **Database**: For persistent storage of gauge metrics, we will use SQLite.swift. SQLite.swift is a type-safe, Swift-friendly wrapper around SQLite. It provides a convenient API for working with SQLite databases, including creating tables, inserting, updating, and querying data. SQLite.swift is lightweight, easy to use, and well-documented.\n\n5. **Testing**: For unit testing, we will use XCTest, the built-in testing framework provided by Apple. XCTest offers a comprehensive set of tools and APIs for writing and running tests. It supports features like test assertions, test expectations, and test coverage analysis. XCTest is widely used in the iOS development community and integrates well with Xcode.\n\n## Swift Package Name\n```swift\n"AviationGaugeWidget"\n```\n\n## File List\n```swift\n[\n    "MainView.swift",\n    "GaugeView.swift",\n    "Speedometer.swift",\n    "YawGauge.swift",\n    "DataManager.swift",\n    "NetworkManager.swift",\n    "DatabaseManager.swift",\n    "TestManager.swift",\n    "TestReport.swift",\n    "Utils.swift"\n]\n```\n\n## Data Structures and Interface Definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class MainView{\n        +var gaugeView: GaugeView\n        +func startTest()\n        +func endTest()\n    }\n\n    class GaugeView{\n        +var speedometer: Speedometer\n        +var yawGauge: YawGauge\n        +func customizeAppearance()\n    }\n\n    class Speedometer{\n        +var speed: Double\n        +func updateSpeed(newSpeed: Double)\n    }\n\n    class YawGauge{\n        +var yaw: Double\n        +func updateYaw(newYaw: Double)\n    }\n\n    class DataManager{\n        +func adjustMetrics(metric: String, value: Double)\n        +func saveMetrics()\n        +func retrieveMetrics() -> [String: Double]\n    }\n\n    class NetworkManager{\n        +func sendRequest(url: String, parameters: [String: Any], completion: (Result<Data, Error>) -> Void)\n    }\n\n    class DatabaseManager{\n        +func createTable(tableName: String)\n        +func insertData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any])\n        +func updateData(tableName: String, data: [String: Any], condition: String)\n        +func queryData(tableName: String, condition: String) -> [[String: Any]]\n    }\n\n    class TestManager{\n        +func runTest()\n        +func writeTestReport(report: TestReport)\n    }\n\n    class TestReport{\n        +var testName: String\n        +var testResult: String\n        +var testDate: Date\n    }\n\n    class Utils{\n        +static func formatSpeed(speed: Double) -> String\n        +static func formatYaw(yaw: Double) -> String\n    }\n\n    MainView "1" -- "1" GaugeView: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" Speedometer: has\n    GaugeView "1" -- "1" YawGauge: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" NetworkManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" DatabaseManager: has\n    DataManager "1" -- "1" TestManager: has\n    TestManager "1" -- "1" TestReport: has\n```\n\n## Program Call Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as MainView\n    participant G as GaugeView\n    participant D as DataManager\n    participant N as NetworkManager\n    participant DB as DatabaseManager\n    participant TM as TestManager\n    participant TR as TestReport\n    participant U as Utils\n\n    M->>G: startTest()\n    G->>D: adjustMetrics(metric, value)\n    D->>N: sendRequest(url, parameters)\n    N-->>D: completion(result)\n    D->>DB: insertData(tableName, data)\n    D->>DB: queryData(tableName, condition)\n    DB-->>D: data\n    D->>TM: writeTestReport(report)\n    TM->>TR: init(testName, testResult, testDate)\n    TR-->>TM: report\n    TM-->>M: report\n    M->>G: endTest()\n```\n\n## Anything Unclear\nThere are no unclear points., Project Manager: ##
