            You are tasked with developing an iOS application tailored for both iPad and iPhone devices. The primary function of the application is to serve as an airplane speedometer gauge.
            
            ## Instructions:
            
            ### Development Environment:
            - Use Swift as the primary programming language.
            - Utilize UIKit for the main development components.
            
            ### Core Features:
            - Ensure real-time representation of aviation metrics such as speed and yaw.
            - Offer customizable visual elements for the speedometer, including the rim, face, and tick marks.
            - Implement smooth visual transitions using Core Animation.
            
            ### Data Management:
            - Implement functionalities to adjust, save, and retrieve gauge metrics.
            - Leverage Core Data for persistent storage of these metrics.
            
            ### Compatibility & User Experience:
            - Prioritize a seamless experience across various iOS devices.
            - Design an intuitive user interface to enhance the user experience.
            
            ### Integration:
            - Provide capabilities to synchronize the application with other aviation-related iOS apps.
            
            

I need all of this on one line.  Will you please put the "\n"s in for me?
