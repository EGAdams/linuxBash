Make Agents one at a time for tasks.


Here are the LangChain components:
# Agents
- how to get started.
---
# Memory
- How to add memory to an agent - https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/agents/

- plan and execute - https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/plan_and_execute.html

# Document Loaders

# Text Splitters

# Vector Stores
- The latest python code for this is in the agents/pinecone_dave_s directory.  Looks like the embeddings work for the conversation, but I think the unique ids are storing too much data at a time.  That's one reason why I want to try the tree-sitter methods.

- The LangChain Document Loaders and Text Splitters are not being used in this code.  Dave S. does not use langchain in his example code which we are using.

- We are in the process of embedding a directory code using the tree-sitter repository code.

Next steps:
- We need an example folder full of code that we can use to test the embedding.

## Then there are the ones that I don't understand yet:
# Output Parsers

# Example Selectors
